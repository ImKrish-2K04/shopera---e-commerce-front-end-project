> **A simple yet powerful e-commerce frontend clone with a logical cart system.** 🚀

## 🔥 Features

## ⚠️ Important Note on LocalStorage Cart Behavior

Since the cart system is based on **LocalStorage**, the page **won't reflect cart updates immediately** after adding or removing products. Changes will be visible **only after a page refresh** because LocalStorage **does not trigger any events to update the UI dynamically**. This is an expected behavior and not a bug. Future updates may include event-based reactivity to enhance the user experience. 🚀
